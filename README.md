# PGR-crowd: A hybrid approach toward biomedical relation extraction training corpora: combining distant supervision with crowdsourcing


This project encompasses the following contributions:

- Pipeline for RE crowdsourcing (some auxiliary functions for MTurk submission).

- New release of the PGR dataset (PGR-crowd).

- Assessment of the quality of results obtained with the MTurk platform (through statistical analysis and direct comparison with on-site rater and domain expert).

Our academic paper which describes the work in detail, will soon be available [here](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baaa104/6013761).
