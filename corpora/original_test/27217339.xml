  <sentence id="27217339.s0" text="Complex recessive spastic paraplegias have in the past been frequently associated with mutations in SPG11 (spatacsin), double-strand break repair via homologous recombination/SPG15, SPG7 (paraplegin) and a handful of other rare genes, but many cases remain genetically undefined.">

  <sentence id="27217339.s1" text="In the remaining cases, next generation sequencing was carried out revealing variants in a number of other known complex spastic paraplegia genes, including five in SPG7 (5/97), four in FA2H (also known as SPG35) (4/97) and two in ZFYVE26/double-strand break repair via homologous recombination Variants were identified in genes usually associated with pure spastic paraplegia and also in the Parkinson*s disease-associated gene ATP13A2, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis gene TPP1 and the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy DNMT1 gene, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of spastic paraplegia.">
