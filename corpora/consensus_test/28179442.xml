  <sentence id="28179442.s0" text="Our objective was to determine molecular phenotypes of asthma by analysing sputum cell transcriptomics from 104 moderate-to-severe asthmatic subjects and 16 nonasthmatic subjects.After filtering on the differentially expressed genes between eosinophil- and noneosinophil-associated sputum inflammation, we used unbiased hierarchical clustering on 508 differentially expressed genes and gene negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated variation analysis of specific gene sets.We defined three transcriptome-associated clusters (TACs): TAC1 (characterised by immune receptors &lt;i&gt;IL33R&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CCR3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TSLPR&lt;/i&gt;), TAC2 (characterised by interferon-, tumour necrosis factor-α- and inflammasome-associated genes) and TAC3 (characterised by genes of metabolic pathways, ubiquitination and mitochondrial function).">
