Single-gene variant analysis showed significant associations of the TT genotype of @GENE$ and the rare GG genotype of transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair with bladder @DISEASE$ susceptibility (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.22-1.40, P &lt; 0.0001).	1
Single-gene variant analysis showed significant associations of the TT genotype of lipid hydroxylation and the rare GG genotype of @GENE$ with bladder @DISEASE$ susceptibility (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.22-1.40, P &lt; 0.0001).	1
At surgery, the @GENE$ was located within the epineurium, could be bluntly dissected from the nerve fascicles, and was suspected to be a @DISEASE$.	1
Fluorescence in situ hybridization, with a break-apart probe strategy, demonstrated @GENE$ rearrangement, consistent in this morphological context with the low-grade fibromyxoid @DISEASE$-associated FUS-CREB3L2 or FUS-CREB3L1 fusions.	1
The association replicated in the UK Biobank sample (odds ratio = 1.25, <i>P</i> = 6.8 × 10<sup>-14</sup>), and the effect is independent of known @DISEASE$ risk factors, including body @GENE$ index (BMI).	1
