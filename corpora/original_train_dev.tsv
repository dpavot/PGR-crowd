Therefore, this study suggests that the lysosome localization loss and translational elongations by the 3' UTR of the @GENE$ mutations may be a relatively frequent genetic cause of axonal peripheral neuropathy with the specific characteristics of @DISEASE$ dominant weakness	0
Additionally, the previously reported @GENE$ @DISEASE$ risk locus was statistically significant only in patients with positive regulation of gene expression-nonamplified high-risk tumors (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.75, Pmeta = 1.51 × 10-8; Pmeta = .95).	0
Although mutations in keratan sulfate biosynthetic process, fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway, negative regulation of kinase activity, and @GENE$ typically lead to skeletal dysplasia, and mutations in adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of receptor internalization1, cellular response to hormone stimulus, response to estradiol, cell activation, signal transduction, and IGF1R usually underlie hormonal defects of the growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) axis, such mutations have also been identified in patients with idiopathic @DISEASE$ (ISS).	1
Studying consanguineous families with Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia syndrome (GHDD), a disorder of @DISEASE$, we identified mutations in @GENE$, which encodes thromboxane synthase (TXAS).	1
The scope of the present review is to recapitulate and review the evidence of @GENE$ participation in @DISEASE$ development and progression, exploring the clinical, biological and functional descriptions of the involvement of this protein in diverse neoplasias.	0
Animal models of viral-associated blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and experimental cerebral malaria (@GENE$) have identified perforin as critical for inducing pathologic @DISEASE$ nervous system CNS vascular permeability.	0
Taken together, these findings offer additional insight into the early transcriptional changes caused by @GENE$ and negative regulation of intracellular transport mutations associated with autosomal dominant human @DISEASE$, and indicate that the transcript levels of certain genes are affected by the expression of mutant α-crystallin in vivo	1
Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous acceptor splice-site mutation in intron 6 of the @GENE$ gene in a patient from a consanguineous Turkish family who presented with congenital microcephaly, lissencephaly, short stature, polysyndactyly, and @DISEASE$.	0
Insufficient signaling through one or more of these metabolite-sensing GPCRs likely contributes to human diseases such as asthma, food allergies, @GENE$ 1 and type 2 diabetes, hepatic @DISEASE$, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases	0
For all six genes, @DISEASE$ in AA had higher expression of poor prognosis genes (visual perception, L-serine metabolic process, @GENE$, dTMP biosynthetic process) and lower expression of good prognosis genes (positive regulation of cell death, DNA damage response, signal transduction by p53 class mediator resulting in cell cycle arrest).	0
We have applied whole exome sequencing to a patient with congenital lactic @DISEASE$, muscle weakness, profound deficiencies in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation associated with loss of mtDNA copy number and MRI abnormalities consistent with Leigh syndrome, identifying biallelic variants in the @GENE$ (NM_004793.3) gene; c.1693T &gt; C predicting p.(Tyr565His) and c.2197G &gt; A predicting p.(Glu733Lys); no evidence of the classical skeletal or dental defects observed in CODAS syndrome patients were noted in our patient.	0
This report describes for the first time a patient with @GENE$ deficiency presenting with @DISEASE$ (polymicrogyria), developmental delay, and platelet secretion defect	0
We concluded that genetic polymorphisms in @GENE$ and CASP14 are associated with risk for brain @DISEASE$ in Korean children.	0
The genes HLA complex P5 (HCP5), spermatogenesis associated 2 (regulation of tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway), @DISEASE$ necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (@GENE$), TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1 (glycoprotein biosynthetic process) and the component of oligomeric Golgi complex 6 (COG6) were reported to be associated with psoriasis in western populations by genome-wide association studies.	0
Together, our findings suggest that in CRC TIAM1 suppresses @DISEASE$ progression by regulating @GENE$/positive regulation of cell proliferation activity	0
These experiments identify a role for mitofusins in directly regulating mitochondrial transport and offer important insight into the cell @GENE$ specificity and molecular mechanisms of @DISEASE$ in microtubule-based movement and dominant optic atrophy	0
