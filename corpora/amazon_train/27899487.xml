  <sentence id="27899487.s1" text="Our studies show that DKD susceptibility was linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, mediated largely by negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II-Ednra in glomerular endothelial cells representing an early event in DKD progression, and suggest that cross talk between glomerular endothelial injury and podocytes leads to defects and depletion, albuminuria, and glomerulosclerosis">
