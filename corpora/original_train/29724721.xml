  <sentence id="29724721.s1" text="This study points to the likely importance of histone modifications in osteosarcoma and highlights the strong genetic similarities between human and dog osteosarcoma, suggesting that canine osteosarcoma may serve as an excellent model for developing treatment strategies in both species.&lt;b&gt;Significance:&lt;/b&gt; Canine osteosarcoma genomics identify regulation of double-strand break repair via homologous recombination as a possible oncogenic driver of osteosarcoma, and findings establish the canine model as a useful comparative model for the corresponding human disease.">
