SENTENCE
Kleefstra syndrome<span>&#44;</span> a disease with intellectual disability<span>&#44;</span> <b>autism</b> spectrum disorders and other developmental defects is caused in humans by haploinsufficiency of <b>EHMT1</b>.
Defects of <b>CIB2</b><span>&#44;</span> calcium- and integrin-binding protein 2<span>&#44;</span> have been reported to cause isolated deafness<span>&#44;</span> DFNB48 and Usher syndrome type-IJ<span>&#44;</span> characterized by congenital profound deafness<span>&#44;</span> balance defects and <b>blindness</b>.
In this study<span>&#44;</span> we evaluated the effect of <b>STAT3</b> inactivation on biologic behavior of primary (Caco-2) and metastatic colon <b>cancer</b> cells (LoVo and SNU407) and the relation of p-STAT3 expression with the invasion of colon tumor.
We have developed a gene-environment interaction model of <b>holoprosencephaly</b> in mice<span>&#44;</span> in which mutation of the Sonic hedgehog coreceptor<span>&#44;</span> <b>Cdon</b><span>&#44;</span> synergizes with transient in utero exposure to ethanol.
Conclusion: Cases with <b>NBAS</b> gene defects often manifests as <b>short stature</b><span>&#44;</span> optic nerve atrophy<span>&#44;</span> Pelger-Huet anomaly<span>&#44;</span> skeletal dysplasia<span>&#44;</span> recurrent infections<span>&#44;</span> abnormality of liver enzymes<span>&#44;</span> progeroid appearance<span>&#44;</span> proptosis<span>&#44;</span> hypotonia and immunodeficiency.
The created databases include ACAD8 (isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD))<span>&#44;</span> ACADSB (short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency)<span>&#44;</span> AUH (3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGCA))<span>&#44;</span> DHCR7 (Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome)<span>&#44;</span> <b>HMGCS2</b> (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 deficiency)<span>&#44;</span> HSD17B10 (17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase X deficiency)<span>&#44;</span> FKBP14 (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with progressive <b>kyphoscoliosis</b><span>&#44;</span> myopathy<span>&#44;</span> and hearing loss; EDSKMH) and ROGDI (Kohlschutter-Tonz syndrome).
In particular<span>&#44;</span> MYH9 mutations result in congenital macrothrombocytopenia and predispose to kidney failure<span>&#44;</span> <b>hearing loss</b><span>&#44;</span> and cataracts<span>&#44;</span> MPL and MECOM mutations cause congenital thrombocytopenia evolving into bone marrow failure<span>&#44;</span> whereas thrombocytopenias caused by RUNX1<span>&#44;</span> ANKRD26<span>&#44;</span> and <b>ETV6</b> mutations are characterized by predisposition to hematological malignancies.
Increased expression of the <b>Src</b> homology 2 B adaptor protein 1 (SH2B1) may stimulate the malignant progression of lung cancer<span>&#44;</span> esophageal cancer and <b>neuroblastoma</b>.
<b>FLNB</b>-related disorders are classified as spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT)<span>&#44;</span> Larsen syndrome (LS)<span>&#44;</span> atelosteogenesis (AO)<span>&#44;</span> boomerang dysplasia (BD)<span>&#44;</span> and isolated congenital talipes equinovarus<span>&#44;</span> presenting with scoliosis<span>&#44;</span> short-limbed dwarfism<span>&#44;</span> clubfoot<span>&#44;</span> joint dislocation and other unique <b>skeletal abnormalities</b>.
We further review the variety of melanocytic <b>tumor</b>s associated with such <b>BRAF</b> fusions.
